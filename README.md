# Image Processing GUI with Tkinter

This is a Python project that provides a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* for performing basic and advanced image processing operations using *Tkinter* and *OpenCV*.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

The application includes the following image processing tasks:

- *Point Operations*  
  Apply operations like addition, subtraction, inversion, and scaling on pixel values.

- *Color Operations*  
  Adjust brightness, remove or swap color channels (R, G, B), convert to grayscale.

- *Histogram*  
  Show and modify image histogram: stretching and equalization.

- *Neighborhood Operations*  
  Apply linear and non-linear filters: mean, median, Gaussian blur, etc.

- *Restoration*  
  Denoise and restore images affected by noise like salt & pepper or Gaussian noise.

- *Image Segmentation*  
  Segment the image using thresholding methods (global, local, Otsu).

- *Edge Detection*  
  Detect edges using Sobel, Laplacian, or other filters.

- *Mathematical Morphology*  
  Perform erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and boundary extraction.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Tkinter* for GUI
- *OpenCV* for image processing
- *NumPy* for matrix operations
- *Matplotlib* for plotting (e.g., histograms)

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
